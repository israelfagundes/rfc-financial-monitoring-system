The Financial Monitoring System is designed with a modular, scalable, and secure architecture to meet the demands of real-time financial monitoring and compliance. The key components of the architecture are as follows:

### 2.1 Core Components

#### 1. Data Sources:
- Integration with core banking systems and third-party APIs
- Support for manual data entry for custom financial metrics.

#### 2. Data Processing Layer:
- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):** Collects, cleans, and transforms data for analysis.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Processes transactions in real-time to detect anomalies.
- **Batch processing:** Handles large datasets for periodic analysis.

#### 3. Analytics and Monitoring:
- **Anomaly Detection:** Machine learning models to identify unusual patterns.
- **Risk Scoring:** Assigns risk scores to transactions based on predefined rules.
- **Compliance Monitoring:** Ensures adherence to  KYC and other regulations.

#### 4. User Interface:
- Customizable dashboards for visualizing financial metrics.
- Real-time alerts and notifications for anomalies or compliance breaches.
- Automated generation of financial reports.

#### 5. Storage
- **Data Warehouse:** Stores historical data for analysis and reporting.
- **NoSQL Databases:** For real-time transaction data.
- **Backup Systems:** Ensures data redundancy and disaster recovery.

#### 6. Security
- Encryption for data in transit and at rest.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Comprehensive audit logs for accountability.

### 2.2 Deployment Model
- **Cloud-Based Deployment:** Leverages AWS for scalability and flexibility.
- **Multi-Data Center Deployment:** Active-active architecture for high availability and disaster recovery.
- **Containerization:** Uses Docker and Kubernetes for efficient resource management and scaling.

### 2.3 Communication and Integration
- **Event-Driven Architecture:**
  - Message queues (AWS SQS) for real-time transaction processing.
  - Asynchronous communication between services.
- **APIs:**
  - RESTful APIs for integration with external systems.
  - Webhooks for real-time alerts and notifications.

## 3. System SLAs
The Financial Monitoring System will adhere to the following Service Level Agreements (SLAs):

- **Uptime:** 99.99% availability for critical monitoring services.
- **Latency:**
  - Real-time transaction processing: < 100ms per transaction.
- **Alerting:**
  - High-priority alerts: Delivered within 5 seconds.
  - Low-priority alerts: Delivered within 1 minute.
- **Data Retention:**
  - Transaction logs: Retained for a minimum of 5 years and up to 10 years to meet compliance requirements.

## 4. Service Dependencies
The Financial Monitoring System relies on the following services and systems:

- **Core Banking Systems:** For transaction data ingestion.
- **Third-Party APIs:** For fraud detection, credit scoring, and compliance checks.
- **Message Queues:** Amazon SQS for event-driven processing.
- **Cloud Services:** AWS for hosting and storage.
- **Monitoring Tools:** Grafana for system health monitoring.

## 5. Load & Performance Testing

### 5.1 Load Testing
- Simulate up to 1 million transactions per second to ensure system scalability.
- Test under peak load conditions (e.g., end-of-quarter financial reporting).

### 5.2 Performance Testing
- Measure latency for real-time transaction processing.
- Evaluate the performance of machine learning models for anomaly detection.

### 5.3 Stress Testing
- Test system behavior under extreme conditions (e.g., sudden spikes in transaction volume).
- Ensure graceful degradation of non-critical services during overload

## 6. Multi Data-Center Concerns
The Financial Monitoring System is designed to operate across multiple data centers with the following considerations:

- **Active-Active Deployment:** Ensures high availability and load balancing.
- **Data Replication:** Real-time replication of transaction data across data centers.
- **Failover Mechanisms:** Automatic failover to secondary data centers in case of outages.
- **Latency Optimization:** Use of geo-distributed data centers to minimize latency for global users.

## 7. Security Considerations
The Financial Monitoring System incorporates robust security measures to protect sensitive financial data:

- **Encryption:**
  - Data in transit: Encrypted using TLS 1.3.
  - Data at rest: Encrypted using AES-256.
- **Access Control:**
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) with multi-factor authentication (MFA).
  - Least privilege principle for all system users.
- **Audit Logs:**
  - Comprehensive logging of all system activities for accountability.
- **Compliance:**
  - Adheres to PCI DSS, GDPR, and other relevant financial regulations.
- **Incident Response:**
  - Automated alerts for security breaches.
  - Predefined incident response plan for rapid mitigation.

## 8. Testing & Rollout

### 8.1 Testing
- **Unit Testing:** For individual components (e.g., anomaly detection, reporting).
- **Integration Testing:** ensure seamless interaction between services.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Simulate real-world scenarios to validate system functionality.

### 8.2 Rollout Plan
- **Phase 1:** Pilot deployment with a limited set of users.
- **Phase 2:** Gradual rollout to additional users and regions.
- **Phase 3:** Full-scale deployment across all users and data centers.

## 9. Metrics & Monitoring
